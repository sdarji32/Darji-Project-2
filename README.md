Regressional Analysis Of the NBA Salary Cap

  Abstract:
    This paper provides a context in showing how different determinants may play a role in influencing salary for the NBA. 
  The Salary Cap has been adopted by the NBA to provide fair and equal advantage for each of the teams in the NBA.  
  However, these statistics may show that players are overpaid or underpaid and with a recent large increase to the Salary Cap, 
  there may be effects on future salary negotiations. To include more numerical determinants to my model, 
  I added NBA franchise records and compared them to Salary to see their correlations. 
  I obtained my salary data from Kaggle data site for the 2017-2018 season and selected historical NBA record data from Basketball Reference website
